# Alsa Explore

This is a Docker setup for an Alsa Explore image. At present, this consists of a slightly broken version of the [amixer](https://fossies.org/linux/alsa-utils/amixer/amixer.c) ALSA utility by [Jaroslav Kysela](perex@perex.cz).

Source code and Dockerfile are in [this repository](https://github.com/mikebrady/alsaexplore).

This is a very volatile respository at present. Please do not rely on it.
